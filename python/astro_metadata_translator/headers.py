def merge_headers(headers, mode="overwrite"):
    """Merge multiple headers into a single dict.

    Given a list of dict-like data headers, combine them following the
    specified mode.

    Parameters
    ----------
    headers : `list` of `dict` (or `dict`-like)
        Collection of headers to combine. `~lsst.daf.base.PropertyList`
        is supported.
    mode : `str`
        Scheme to use when a header has the same key as another header
        but different value. Options are:

        - ``'overwrite'`` : Value in later header overwrites earlier value.
        - ``'drop'`` : Entire key is dropped.
        - ``'first'`` : Retain first value encountered.
        - ``'append'`` : Convert value to list with a value for each header
          (`None` if the key was not present). If the value is
          identical in multiple headers but key is missing in
          some, then the single identical header is stored.

    Returns
    -------
    merged : `dict`
        Single `dict` combining all the headers using the specified
        combination mode.
